Exploring compositional data, quarto blog posts, and Positron all at the same time for my own learning.

Aitchison, "The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data"

# Chapter 1

Load some datasets from Aitchison, "The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data"fr in the "compositions" package.

```{r}
library(compositions)
library(tidyverse)

#install.packages("isopleuros")

library(isopleuros)
```

# Data 1
Hongite and Kongite from chapter 1. 
A, B, C, D, and E are albite, blandite, cornite, daubite, and endite. 

```{r}
#run if needed
#data(package="compositions")

# Data 1
data("Hongite")
head(Hongite)
```


# Data 2
```{r}
data("Kongite")
head(Kongite)
```

# Data 3
```{r}
# depth is possible covariate
data("Boxite")
head(Boxite)
```

# Data 4
```{r}
data("Coxite")
head(Coxite)
```

# Data 5
```{r}
# Rows 1-3 are the compositions, and row 4 is a covariate (water depth) which may account for some of the variation in the compositions
data("ArcticLake")
head(ArcticLake)
```

# Ternary diagram
Re-creating Figure 1.2
```{r}
# Reorder columns to sand, silt, clay
arctic_reordered <- ArcticLake[, c("silt", "clay", "sand")]

# Plot with reordered vertices
ternary_plot(arctic_reordered)
ternary_grid()
```
